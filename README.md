# NoÃ«l Willener

Thats me, i do Webdevelopment for a living and i guess thats also what this Website is used for... not for Webdevelopment but to spread the word.

As of today this Website is under construction and will accessible to the Public as soon as i have a first Version done. I guess there will be a lot of changes after the first release because im not really a Webdesigner so im still constantly learning new stuff i wanna Implement.

## Quick start

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
